# Module: FindSDL2
################################################################################
# Defines:
#   * Imported targets:
#       REngine::SDL2
#   * Variables:
#       SDL2_FOUND          - If false, do not try to link to SDL
#       SDL2_LIBRARY        - The name of the library to link against
#       SDL2_LIBRARIES      - 
#       SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR    - The location of SDL.h
#       SDL2_VERSION_STRING - String containing the version of SDL
################################################################################
#
# Flags:
#   SDL2_BUILDING_LIBRARY
#
# If this is defined, then no SDL2_main will be linked in because only 
# applications need main(). Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an 
# application and this module will attempt to locate and set the proper link
# flags as part of the returned SDL2_LIBRARY variable.
#
# Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the
# OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which
# this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
# module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
#
# Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL2_LIBRARY_TEMP in your
# configuration and no SDL2_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL
# library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc). Set
# SDL2_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again.
# Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this
# value as appropriate. These values are used to generate the final
# SDL2_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL2_LIBRARY
# does not get created.
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
# ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL. l.e.galup 9-20-02
#
# Modified by Eric Wing. Added code to assist with automated building
# by using environmental variables and providing a more
# controlled/consistent search behavior. Added new modifications to
# recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
# guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
# platforms. Added a search for threads which is needed by some
# platforms. Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL2_LIBRARY to
# override this selection or set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
# "SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>. This is done for portability reasons
# because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).
